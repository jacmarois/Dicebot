# Dicebot
A simple Discord dice bot.

Any message beginning with d# or #d# (ie: d6 or 5d20) will receive a roll or list of rolls.
If the user specifies a multi-dice roll, at the bottom of the list will be the summation of the rolls.
The user can also enable or disable "clean chat", which auto deletes messages the bot sends and messages 
that call the bot after 30 seconds.
